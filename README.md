## Understanding the Multi-City Visualization

### Main Plot Elements

1. **Gray Dashed Line**: Perfect calibration (y = x)
   - Markets are perfectly calibrated if points fall on this line

2. **Colored Shaded Bands**: City-specific calibration uncertainty
   - 95% confidence intervals accounting for finite sample sizes
   - Colors match city-specific color scheme
   - Wider bands indicate fewer observations in that probability range

3. **Colored Dashed Vertical Lines**: City-specific base event rates
   - Overall frequency of YES outcomes for each city
   - Reference points for skill score calculations

4. **Colored Circles**: City-specific bin averages
   - Size indicates number of observations in each bin
   - Color coding matches each city's assigned color
   - Hover tooltips show predicted vs. observed frequencies

5. **Small Colored Dots**: Individual market outcomes (rug plot)
   - Color-coded by city
   - Y-axis: 0 for NO outcomes, 1 for YES outcomes
   - Opacity reduced in comparison mode to minimize clutter

### Mode-Specific Features

**Combined Mode**:
- Single blue calibration curve pooling all cities
- Unified statistics shown in status bar
- Maximum statistical power for overall assessment

**By City Mode**:
- Separate calibration curves for each selected city
- Individual city statistics displayed
- Best for identifying city-specific patterns

**Comparison Mode**:
- Overlaid calibration curves with city-specific colors
- Comparative statistics sorted by Brier score
- Individual points hidden to reduce visual clutter

### Statistical Metrics

- **Brier Score**: Lower is better (0 = perfect, 0.25 = random)
  - Measures the mean squared difference between predictions and outcomes
  - Formula: `BS = (1/N) × Σ(predicted_prob - outcome)²`

- **Skill Score**: Higher is better (1 = perfect, 0 = no skill)
  - Performance relative to always predicting the base rate
  - Formula: `SS = 1 - (Brier_Score / Brier_Reference)`

- **Base Rate**: City-specific frequency of high temperature events
  - Varies by city due to different climatic conditions
  - Important for contextualizing skill scores

## Technical Implementation

### Multi-City Data Pipeline

1. **Market Discovery**: 
   - Generates event tickers for all cities based on date patterns
   - Fetches market lists for each city's events via Kalshi API
   - Handles different data availability windows per city

2. **Price Data Collection**:
   - Downloads candlestick data for all cities in specified time windows
   - Handles multiple API endpoints and fallback intervals
   - Computes mid-prices from bid-ask spreads across all markets

3. **Outcome Resolution**:
   - Retrieves final settlement data for all city markets
   - Maps settlement prices to binary outcomes (YES/NO)
   - Maintains city attribution throughout processing

4. **Time Series Processing**:
   - Converts timestamps to Eastern Time (consistent across all cities)
   - Creates time-of-day indexing (minutes since window start)
   - Clips probabilities to avoid numerical issues

### Enhanced Caching Strategy

The application implements intelligent multi-city caching:

```python
# Multi-city cache file
CACHE_FILE = "kalshi_multi_city_temp_cache.pkl"

# Cache contains processed data for all cities
{
    'calibration_data': [
        {
            'city': 'NYC',
            'city_name': 'New York City',
            'event': 'KXRIGHNY-25JAN27',
            'market': 'KXRIGHNY-25JAN27-B65',
            'time_of_day_minutes': [0, 15, 30, ...],
            'probs': [0.45, 0.47, 0.52, ...],
            'outcome': 1,  # or 0
            'category': 'mid',
            'avg_prob': 0.48
        },
        # ... data for all cities
    ],
    'city_stats': {
        'NYC': {'name': 'New York City', 'markets': 150, 'yes': 75, 'no': 75, 'base_rate': 0.500},
        # ... stats for all cities
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Integration

The Bokeh application uses enhanced CustomJS callbacks for multi-city interactivity:
- City selection filtering
- Mode-specific visualization updates
- Dynamic binning calculations across cities
- Multi-city statistical metric updates
- City-specific uncertainty band computation

## Market Categories

Markets are automatically categorized by average probability across all cities:
- **very_low**: < 20%
- **low**: 20-40%  
- **mid**: 40-60%
- **high**: 60-80%
- **very_high**: > 80%

This enables analysis of calibration across different confidence levels and cities.

## Regional Climate Considerations

### Expected Base Rate Variations
Different cities will naturally have different base rates for high temperature events:
- **Miami**: Likely higher base rates due to consistently warm climate
- **Denver**: Potentially more variable due to altitude and continental climate
- **Los Angeles**: May show seasonal patterns due to Mediterranean climate
- **Chicago**: Likely shows strong seasonal variation

### Calibration Expectations
- Cities with more extreme climates may show better calibration due to clearer weather patterns
- Cities with more variable weather may present greater forecasting challenges
- Cross-city analysis helps identify whether calibration differences are due to market mechanics or climate predictability

## Important Notes

### API Rate Limits
- The Kalshi API has rate limits; processing all cities requires extended runtime
- Large date ranges across multiple cities may require significant time
- Intelligent caching minimizes repeated API calls during analysis

### Data Size Considerations
```python
# Multi-city exports can be very large
EXPORT_CSV = False           # Enable with caution
EXPORT_SUMMARY_CSV = True    # Recommended for initial analysis
# Estimated sizes displayed before export
```

### Time Zone Handling
- All times converted to Eastern Time for consistency across cities
- Market windows assume Eastern Time trading hours for all cities
- Timestamps properly handled across daylight saving transitions

## Interpretation Guidelines

### Multi-City Calibration Assessment

**Good Overall Calibration**:
- Points cluster near diagonal across most cities
- Uncertainty bands contain the diagonal consistently
- Similar calibration patterns across different climates

**Regional Calibration Differences**:
- Systematic city-specific deviations from diagonal
- Varying uncertainty band widths (sample size effects)
- Base rate differences reflecting local climate patterns

**Skill Assessment Across Cities**:
- Compare Brier scores across cities in Comparison mode
- Look for consistent skill patterns vs. city-specific anomalies
- Consider base rate differences when interpreting skill scores

### Mode-Specific Analysis

**Combined Mode Analysis**:
- Use for overall market calibration assessment
- Maximum statistical power for detecting systematic biases
- Best for general conclusions about Kalshi temperature markets

**By City Mode Analysis**:
- Identify cities with particularly good/poor calibration
- Understand regional forecasting challenges
- Detect city-specific market behavior patterns

**Comparison Mode Analysis**:
- Direct skill comparison across cities
- Identify consistently well-calibrated vs. problematic markets
- Understand relative forecasting difficulty by region

## Customization Options

### Adding New Cities
```python
# Add new cities to the configuration
CITY_CONFIGS["SEATTLE"] = {
    "ticker": "KXRIGHSEA", 
    "name": "Seattle", 
    "color": "#2ca02c"
}
```

### Adjusting Time Windows
```python
# Analyze different time periods
START_PREV_DAY_HOUR_ET = 8   # Start at 8 AM previous day
END_DAY_HOUR_ET = 23         # End at 11 PM event day
```

### Custom Analysis Modes
```python
# Add new analysis modes in the JavaScript callback
ANALYSIS_MODES = ["combined", "by_city", "comparison", "regional"]
```

## Output Files

Running the multi-city application creates several files:

1. **`kalshi_multi_city_temp_cache.pkl`**: Processed data cache for all cities
2. **`kalshi_multi_city_temp_calibration.html`**: Interactive multi-city visualization
3. **`kalshi_multi_city_temp_summary.csv`**: Market-level summary data (recommended)
4. **`kalshi_multi_city_temp_data.csv`**: Full time series data (if enabled)
5. **`kalshi_multi_city_temp_data.json`**: Structured JSON export (if enabled)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Multi-City Issues

**"No calibration data loaded"**
- Check internet connection for API access across all cities
- Verify city tickers exist and have settled markets
- Ensure date range includes available data for multiple cities

**Uneven city data**
- Some cities may have different market availability windows
- Use city selection controls to focus on cities with sufficient data
- Check city-specific statistics in the output

**Large memory usage**
- Reduce LOOKBACK_DAYS for shorter analysis periods
- Disable full CSV export for memory-intensive runs
- Use fewer cities for initial testing

**Slow performance**
- Enable caching (FORCE_REFRESH = False)
- Process cities sequentially (handled automatically)
- Use smaller date ranges for initial testing

### Debug Configuration
```python
# Enable detailed logging
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Force fresh data download
FORCE_REFRESH = True

# Reduce scope for testing
LOOKBACK_DAYS = 7
CITY_CONFIGS = {"NYC": CITY_CONFIGS["NYC"]}  # Test with single city
```
